# Tapntable - backend

## Description

**Tapntable** is a web app implementing a restaurant Point of Sale (POS). It is a web-based app designed to manage the operations of a restaurant: Employee timeclock, manage checks and orders, track payments, track servers sales &  cash bank, track and manage items sold and availability. This would be used as a terminal or terminals in a restaurant for servers & bartenders to use or with tableside tablets.

At a high level, the app's backend is implemented with a PostgreSQL database and a RESTful API implemented in Javascript and Express. The frontend is implemented in React, using a Redux store and Googleâ€™s Material UI for design elements.

The front end repository: <https://github.com/Keparoo/tapntable>

## Deployment

The backend is currently deployed to: <https://tapntable.herokuapp.com/>

## Database Schema

The current version of the database schema (v2.2.2) is below.

* users, user_logs, checks, orders, items, ordered_items, item_categories, destinations, payments, represent phase 1 and are currently implemented.
* mods, mod_categories, ordered_items_mods, mod_groupsm mods_mod_groups, and items_mod_groups represent phase 2 and are currently implemented.  
* discounts, discount_details will be implemented next in phase 3
* Note: the `checks` and the `item_ordered` tables contain a `discount_id` column. This column is currently unused and will reference the table `discounts` when phase 3 is implemented.  
* 3 enum tables have been defined:
  * user_role
    * 'trainee', 'employee', 'cook', 'host', 'server', 'bartender', 'head-server', 'bar-manager', 'chef', 'manager', 'owner'
  * log_event
    * 'clock-in', 'clock-out', 'cash-out', 'declare-cash-tips', 'open-shift', 'close-shift', 'open-day', 'close-day', 'discount-item', 'discount-check', 'create-item', 'update-item','delete-item-ordered', 'void-item', 'void-check'
  * payment_type
    * 'Cash', 'MC', 'Visa', 'Amex', 'Disc', 'Google', 'Apple','Venmo'

### Regarding users, login and auth

User currently includes these fields:

* id (serial primary key)
* username (unique)
* password
* pin (unique) (Used by user to punch-in, log-in and use the frontend interface)
* display_name (Name displayed on frontend interface and printed checks)
* first_name
* last_name
* role (role determining POS response and user's allowed actions: This is an enum)
* is_clocked_in
* is_active (Boolean, to mark employees no longer active)

Logging in and out of a typical Restaurant POS is typically different than a standard web app. Access to the POS during a shift needs to be a fast action. A user "identifies" themselves upon arrival to work by typing in a unique (usually 4 digit) PIN. (No username) This action clocks in the user and enables them to then create orders (if their user role indicates they can create/edit orders).

To enter an order, the user enters their pin at a terminal. (A restaurant may have more than one terminal and the result should be the same regardless of which terminal is used.) If the user is clocked-in already, they now see the view showing their current checks if any (and edit them) and allows them to create new checks.

At the end of a shift the server must "cash-out" reconciling their checks and money and then punch out.

Users that don't create orders (cooks for instance) only punch in and out. Their user role would inform the front-end and they would only be shown clock-in and clock-out pages.

Usually a manager/owner accesses the system from an office computer (usually for viewing/printing reports, adding/editing menu items, adding/editing users etc) in addition to logging into the server/bartender terminals as needed.

This app will differentiate between **logging in** and **identification**.

* Authentication is handled by logging in: username and password generating a token which is used in queries to authenticate to the database.
* Identification is handled by entering a user's pin. This simply identifies which user is using a device. (This does not authenticate with the backend. This is a front-end only identification)

Each terminal must be logged into once a day with username and password. This will set a token which expires in 23 hours. Employees using the terminals will be identified by their pin to determine what they see and can do on a terminal. The token that was set (probably by a manger) will be the token used for all db queries from that terminal. In practice, a manager could refresh the tokens when performing the nightly "close-day" functions so that the terminals are ready to go in the morning without the need of the manager to be there.

There is a dashboard for the manager to create new or update existing items as well as a dedicated dashboard for specifically managing and updating the item count (This is aimed at the chef or a kitchen worker to access. A manager can manage item count from the manager's dashboard as well as all other item fields)

## Deployment to Heroku

The folder structure should be similar to this:

```bash
tapntable-backend
tapntable-frontend
```

Itâ€™s important to have this structure because there will be two different deployments, one for the front-end and one for the backend.  

From the backend folder run the following commands

```bash
heroku login
heroku create NAME_OF_APP
echo "web: node server.js" > Procfile
heroku git:remote -a NAME_OF_APP
git add .
git commit -m "ready to deploy backend"
```

These commands will create a web application and the Procfile which tells Heroku what command to run to start the server.

Now that the remote is named, run the following commands in the tapntable-backend folder. Next, push the code to Heroku and copy the local database (which is named tapntable) to the production one (so that there will be  seed data in production)

```bash
git push heroku main
heroku addons:create heroku-postgresql:hobby-dev -a NAME_OF_APP
heroku pg:push tapntable DATABASE_URL -a NAME_OF_APP
heroku config:set PGSSLMODE=no-verify
heroku open
```

To update API, delete and upload new version of database

```bash
git push heroku main
heroku pg:reset
heroku addons:create heroku-postgresql:hobby-dev -a NAME_OF_APP
heroku pg:push tapntable DATABASE_URL -a NAME_OF_APP
heroku config:set PGSSLMODE=no-verify
heroku open
```

If there are any errors, run

```bash
heroku logs -t -a NAME_OF_APP
```
